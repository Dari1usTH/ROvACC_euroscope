Hi!
Before installing this plugin, we would like to thank Agapi Darius and Adrian Szalok for their contributions.
Installation Steps:

    1)Place DiscordEuroscope.dll and DiscordEuroscope_RadioCallsigns.txt into a folder.

    2)Create a directory and move both files into it.
    (Recommended path: LRBB\Plugins\YourFolderName)

    3)Open EuroScope, go to OTHER SET > Plug-ins, and load the .dll file.

Enjoy !
